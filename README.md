original derp.us
================

Several years ago before I got my first job I was writing mostly PHP and had recently learned of using classes and the general idea of OOP. This was one of my first bigger personal projects, which was a pastebin to emulate [ix.io](http://ix.io/) (which is also the guy that made [sprunge.us](http://sprunge.us)).

This is here for archival reasons, and will not see any updates. I've removed some of the dependencies like GeoIP.dat (used by Net_GeoIP) and GeSHi.

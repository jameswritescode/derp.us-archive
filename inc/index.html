<strong>SYNOPSIS</strong>
    <strong>cat file | curl -F option:1='&lt;-' [-F</strong> ... <strong>]</strong>

<strong>DESCRIPTION</strong>
    derp is a command line pastebin, url shortener, and image uploader that can be posted to
    via unix (and in some case Windows DOS or Power Shell) command line and scripts.

<strong>OPTIONS</strong>
    f:N     URL encoded paste data. This is required if you wish to use the pastebin.
    
    img:N   Image data. This is required if you wish to use the image uploader.
    
    url:N   
            URL of website you wish to use with the url shortener. This is required to use 
            the url shortener.

    login   
            Your derp.us account. This is used for tagging pastes, urls, and images to your
            account. To create an account you can send a login with a token and it will
            create the account if it does not already exist. This is also required for
            using the rm command or passwd:N.

    token   Your derp.us account password. This is required for sending with login.

    rm      ID of the paste you would like to delete. Login is required for use.

    name:N  Name of your paste, or image.

    priv:N  
            Private paste, url, or image. If this is sent it will not show up in /user/.
            It will also mark you as "Anonymous" in image and URL information.

    passwd:N
            Password protected paste. This can only be sent if marking a paste priv:N.

    stats   derp.us usage statistics.

    pastes  Sends all the pastes tagged to your login. Login is required for use.

    type:N  
            The type of paste you are sending. This is used for syntax highlighting from
            http://derp.us/ID/. See <a href="#types" onclick="document.getElementById('types').style.color = 'red'">types</a>.

    /user/
            From http://derp.us/user/ you can view pastes made by both users with logins
            and users without logins. You can view pastes made by login via
            http://derp.us/user/login. User data can also be viewed in rss, json, xml, or
            qrcode formats, just append the data type like /user/(login).format.

    /id/    
            From http://derp.us/id/ you can view a paste with line numbers. If a type:N
            was supplied when the paste was made, it will add syntax highlighting. You can
            also append #line-no to /id/ to link to a specific line. Paste data can also
            be viewed in rss, json, xml, or qrcode formats, just append the data type like
            /id.(format)

    /download/
            From http://derp.us/download/id you can download a paste (providing you want it
            on your desktop). If a type:N was sent with the paste, it will (in some cases)
            download with the file format of the language it is in, otherwise it will be a
            .txt file.

    /report/
            From http://derp.us/report/id you can report a paste, URL, or image by making id
            the corresponding id. If a derp administrator deams it malicious or otherwise, it
            will be removed, and possibly blacklisted (if it is a URL).
    
    /search/
            From http://derp.us/search/ you can search through pastes for things that hold
            data related to your search.
